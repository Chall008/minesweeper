Here is a video of the animated background and a sample of features:

Assignemet objective: 


    Create the app using React.
    Use an API to create the basic game logic.

    1. Create a button to create a new game. Use the animated gif above as a user interface guide. Do at least that much, but also feel free to have fun.
    2. Style the cells appropriately.
    3. Left-clicking a cell performs the check action
    4. Right/secondary clicking a cell performs the flag action
    5. When the game status changed to won or lost a victory or failure message - Do not use alert for this. Update the user interface.

Things that need improvement:
 
    I wanted the section that says, "Mines: (and count of mines)" to be centered and not attached to the title in the beginning.
    I could only get the Easy mode to work and was working on implementing the other two difficulties.
    Added bonus - I wanted to add an audio of 8bit music (like tetris, or any old NES game.) but could not get the features to hide in the background.
